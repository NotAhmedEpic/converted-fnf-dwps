# converted-fnf-dwps
Heya! Its me, NotAhmedEpic from the Nintendo Wii! Of course I am joking. Since there's not that many good DWP's of FNF characters, I will convert various voicebanks, chromatics and soundfont (SF2 and SFZ) and post them here. I will also convert FLP's to MIDI's.
Also, these will work **ONLY** on *FL Mobile* DirectWave, not on *FL PC* DirectWave.

CREDITS:

Chromatic Scales:
 ~ ExtendedCentral
 ~ Chimmiemdp

Voicebanks:
 ~ GenoX
 ~ Blantados
 ~ Aussie Axe

Soundfonts (SF2 and SFZ)
 ~ SuperStamps
 ~ LoganMcOof

Oh yeah. I will also be using OFFICIAL chroms, sf2's and voicebanks. 
Each will have their own README file respectively. Except to see DWP's of og chroms/soundfonts/voicebanks by bbpanzu, The_Mayz, Rozebud, etc.
